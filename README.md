Tri-Fly: Distributed Estimation of Global and Local Triangle Counts in Graph Streams
========================
**Tri-Fly** is a distributed streaming algorithm for global and local triangle counting in graph streams. 
**Tri-Fly** has the following advantages compared to baselines: 
 * Accurate: Tri-Fly produces up to 4.5X smaller estimation error
 * Fast: Tri-Fly runs in linear time up to 8.8X faster
 * Theoretically Sound: Tri-Fly gives unbiased estimates with variances inversely proportional to the number of machines
